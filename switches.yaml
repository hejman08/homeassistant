#Slowly but surely making all the switches be dummies so I can have a script send multiple code_on/code_off in quick succession as sending only one tends to work only sometimes.
#so far the bedroom fan and office fan are like this, the other switches are either unused or rarely used enough that I haven't bothered yet.
#Following the chain: Switch is clicked or triggered by Google Home > Automation triggers based on that > Automation fires script > Script fires shell command to 
#send signal like 9 times in quick succession.
